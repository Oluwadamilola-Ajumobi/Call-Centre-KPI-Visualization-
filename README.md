KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are quantifiable measurements used to gauge a company's overall long-term performance. This helps to weigh and determine a company's strategic, financial, and operational achievements. They are used to measure a company's success in relations to its set goals and targets. High-level KPIs may focus on the general overview of the performance of the business, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as tech, sales, marketing, HR, support and others. KPIs are more than just numbers in weekly reports - they enable the key business players understand the performance and overall growth of their business so that they can make critical adjustments in the execution of their strategic goals. Knowing and measuring the right KPIs will help achieve results faster.
